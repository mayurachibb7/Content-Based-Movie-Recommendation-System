# Content Based Movie Recommendation System
The proposed movie recommendation system was trained on 10,000 records of “The Movies Dataset” available on Kaggle. The data was cleaned, pre-processed and converted into a format appropriate for further analysis. A thorough EDA was conducted  to identify the outliers, missing values, inconsistencies or errors in the dataset which may affect further analysis. A word soup was created for each movie by concatenating genres, production companies, keywords and actors features. This word soup was transformed into a 300-dimensional numerical vector using the TF-IDF weighted Word2Vec algorithm. A similarity matrix was created by computing the pairwise cosine similarity between movies in the dataset. These similarity scores were then used for recommending top ten relevant movies to the user.
